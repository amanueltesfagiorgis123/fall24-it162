       <h2 class="subheader"><b>About Me</b></h2>
       
       <p>Hello! I'm Amanuel Tesfagiorgis, currently in my second year at Seattle Central, where I’m pursuing a degree in web design. My passion for technology and creativity has led me to this exciting field, and I'm eager to continue honing my skills.</p>

       <h2 class="subheader"><b>What I Do</b></h2>

       <p>I enjoy <b>collaborating with others</b> and thrive in group environments where communication and teamwork are key. As part of my studies, I’ve gained hands-on experience with web technologies like <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and I’ve also started exploring <b>Java</b>.</p>

       <p>So far, I’ve had the opportunity to design <b>portfolio websites</b> for a couple of friends, which has been a rewarding way to apply what I've learned in class. Seeing a project come to life on the web is incredibly fulfilling, and I look forward to expanding my portfolio with more work.</p>
    

       <p>When I’m not coding or designing, you can usually find me enjoying <b>nature</b>. I love to go on little adventures, exploring new places, and finding peaceful spots to relax and recharge. Whether it's hiking, visiting local parks, or just spending time outdoors, these moments keep me grounded and inspired.</p>
